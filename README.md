#### Hi there! 

#### I'm Jeri, I am a junior software developer transitioning from product design engineering.

Through Hatchways, our team worked on a [MERN stack-based tattoo contest website](https://github.com/hatchways/team-old-fashioned/tree/dev-jeri). In my last project as a product design engineer, I designed and programmed [an automated, portable disinfection device](https://www.pchrd.dost.gov.ph/news/6615-dost-pchrd-wraps-up-activities-for-first-virtual-nstw) with Arduino/C++.
