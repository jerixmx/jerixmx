#### Hi there! I'm Jeri, a physical product design engineer looking to transition to software development.

I'm currently working with a team on a tattoo contest website project through Hatchways. In my last project, I designed and programmed an automated disinfection device with Arduino/C++. 

My current tech stack is C, C++, Python, Javascript, Typescript, MongoDB, ReactJS, Material UI, HTML, CSS, SQL, Linux, Git, and GCC. My understanding of tech is still surface-level at this point but I am eager to learn more!
