### Hi there! I'm Jeri and I'm new to software dev.

I like automating tasks. Sometimes I wonder if the time saved is worth the development time. It's been worth it so far üòÑ

Took a C Programming class in college. Enjoyed it and I thought I did well! Learned some Matlab in grad school. Programmed a disinfection device's control systems and user interface with Arduino, learning as I go. Would that be full stack?

Right now, I'm leaning on back end development with C++. I'm trying to juggle some learning paths and document them here on Github.
