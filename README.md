### Hi there! I'm Jeri and I'm new to software dev.

I like automating tasks. Sometimes I wonder if the time saved is worth the development time. It's been worth it so far üòÑ

Took a C Programming class in college. Enjoyed it and I thought I did well! Learned some Matlab in grad school. Programmed a disinfection device's control systems and user interface with Arduino, learning as I go. Would that be full stack?

Right now, I'm leaning towards back end development with C++. I'm trying to juggle some learning paths and document them here on Github. I also have a [detailed learning log on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7UAxNMvgQR9_rG7uuJqwNiVmnOW0JaWfdZnVrNqjRk/edit?usp=sharing).
