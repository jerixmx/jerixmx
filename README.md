#### Hi there! I'm Jeri, a physical product design engineer looking to transition to software development.

My current tech stack is C, C++, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Linux, Git, and GCC. In my last project, I designed and programmed an automated disinfection device with Arduino/C++. My understanding of tech is still surface-level at this point but I am eager to learn more!

I'm trying to juggle some learning paths and document them here on Github.
